In Windows CMD - 

pip install flask
pip install flask-restful

--------------------------------

In PYTHONANYWHERE.COM -
GOTO BASH CONSOLE - >


mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.6 deploy

pip install flask

pip install flask-restful

----------------------------------

Now in /home/rahulvaish/ create a directory(folder) name it DeployHelloWorld.
Upload your flask file HelloWorldFlask.py in this newly created folder.

-----------------------------------

Now we have a virtual environment and a folder with code file, we need to develop an app with configuration to link both of them -

Create a new Web App -> Next -> Next -> Manual configuration-> Python 3.6 -> Next -> Next -> Default App prepared !
Now, when the default app is made, we need to perform two major ssettings - 
[1] Enter the name of virtual environment 'deploy' which turns the linking as '/home/rahulvaish/.virtualenvs/deploy'
[2] Make change in the '/var/www/rahulvaish_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py' as below:



# +++++++++++ FLASK +++++++++++

import sys

path = '/home/rahulvaish/DeployHelloWorld'
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(path)

from HelloWorldFlask import app as application


# +++++++++++ FLASK +++++++++++
